  remiPanel1: Look around you! This is what the greenhouse looks like now.
  remiPanel2: You are now going on a scavenger hunt to find the items that make up
    this smart greenhouse!
  remiPanel4: Look around and walk up to the rainbow with your iPad. When you are
    close to it, tap it!
  remiPanel5: This lets you read about what role the object plays in the greenhouse!
  remiPanel6: If you think the object is cool, you can tap the heart to like or unlike
    it! Try it out now.
  remiPanel7: Once you are done, tap outside of the card to close it.
  remiPanel8: As you can see the rainbow has turned <color=#00B451>green</color>
    and stoped floating. All found objects will do this!
  remiPanel9: Just as a reminder, unfound objects will float!
  remiPanel11: All of the objects you have to find are listed here. Tap this button
    to show or hide your progress. Try it out now.
  remiPanel12: There are 4 different zones. You must find ALL of the objects in a
    zone to continue.
  remiPanel13: To enter a zone, you need to scan 1 of the 4 zone images. This map
    shows you the location of each of these images in the area.
  remiPanel14: Let's scan the first one now! Hold your iPad as straight as you can
    so that it can see the picture clearly.
  remiPanel15: Great job! Now you can find all of the objects in this zone.
  remiPanel16: Don't forget to watch where you are walking and stay safe. Have fun!
